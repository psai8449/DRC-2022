This repository is a work in progress - not complete.

Vision code used to identify desired robot path based on camera feed.
Camera used was a fisheye lense. 
Blue tape was left side of track and yellow tape was right side (that might be backwards).
Additionally, there were obstacles on the track and junctions where the robot had to choose the correct path.

Missing code to communicate with arduino to drive robot.
